# Simon-Game
I developed a Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to follow a sequence of colored lights and sounds, with JavaScript handling the game logic, including sequence generation and user input validation. The CSS provides a vibrant, interactive interface, making the game visually engaging. This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive, logic-based web applications with a focus on user experience and design.
